# School-Network-Design
A network simulation project designed in Cisco Packet Tracer for a secondary school, completed as a 2024 course project. This project demonstrates network architecture, subnetting, and device configuration to support a robust and secure school computer network.

**Features**

Network topology designed with routers, switches, and servers (web, email, DNS) to meet school requirements.

Subnetting using the IP range 192.168.0.0â€“192.168.255.255, with static and DHCP IP assignments for devices.

Device configurations for routers, switches, and servers, ensuring reliable communication and security.

**Technologies**

Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer

Networking: TCP/IP, subnetting, DHCP, static IP, routing protocols

Concepts: LAN design, network security, server management
